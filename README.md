# Thanks

This is a list of repos, packages, or other resources that we use in our projects and think are awesome.

## Roblox

### UI

- [Vide](https://github.com/centau/vide) is an awesome reactive Luau UI framework. We use it in *Filoxen Research Facilities*.

### Data Management

- [ProfileStore](https://github.com/MadStudioRoblox/ProfileStore) is a module for DataStore profiles that we find useful across many projects.

### Development Tools

- [Wally](https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally) is a package manager for Roblox projects that works with no hassle.
- [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) is a development tool that makes interfacing with other development tools easy. A great productivity booster!

### Organizations

Filoxen's Roblox work wouldn't be possible without groups like [Rchive](https://www.roblox.com/communities/13928593/Rchive) and [Epic Department](https://www.roblox.com/communities/7665231/Epic-Department#!).


## External

### API

- [ElysiaJS](https://github.com/elysiajs/elysia) is a framework for bun and TypeScript that finally settled for our backend use cases after switching between a few. Fast and great to work with :-)

### Research Work

- The [Lune](https://github.com/lune-org/lune) runtime has helped massively in processing large amounts of data relating to places and models.

## General Development Tools

- [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) is an editor that rivals or beats the other big editors in many ways. The Roblox interfacing is still early but it works well with Rojo, luau-lsp, and other tools that we need.
